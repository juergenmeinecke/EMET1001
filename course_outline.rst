Read this entire course outline carefully! 

Any items, rules, requirements in this course outline may be subject to changes. When this happens I will announce it during the lecture. Announcements in the lecture supersede any information contained in this course outline.

**********************
Course Description
**********************

In this course we will study mathematical concepts from real analysis, calculus, and linear algebra and apply them to economics and finance. Particular mathematical concepts and their applications include: sequences and series with application to discounting and present value calculations in finance; differential calculus with application to optimization problems (unconstrained and constrained) such as profit maximization and cost minimization; linear algebra with application to solving systems of equations such as supply and demand models.

============================
Learning Outcome
============================

Ideally, at the end of this course you will

* have a sound understanding of mathematical techniques discussed;
* understand mathematical concepts such as the derivatives from first principles (and not merely from memory)
* be in a position to formulate problems in economics, business, and finance in mathematical terms and apply the tools provided in the course for analyzing them;
* be able to apply the basic principles of maximization and minimization to optimization problems; and to
* apply matrix algebra to simple problems and models;

============================
Textbook
============================

The textbook for the course is *College Mathematics for Business, Economics, Life Sciences and Social Sciences* 12ed, by Barnett, Ziegler, and Byleen. Chiefly library has several copies of the textbook.




============================
Prerequisites
============================

It is strongly recommended that you take EMET1001 during the first year of your studies. Please be aware of the assumed level of mathematical knowledge for EMET1001. As you may recall, the math requirements for the Bachelor of Commerce, the Bachelor of Economics, the Bachelor of Finance, and the Bachelor of International Business is equivalent to the *Maths Methods (Tertiary Major)* in the ACT and *HSC Maths (2 unit) including the study of calculus and algebra* in NSW. (Check the ANU College of Business and Economics 2013 Undergraduate Programs Handbook for other states.)

A standard school curriculum will include (from the Board of Studies NSW): 

* Basic arithmetic and algebra, 
* Real functions, 
* Trigonometric ratios, 
* Linear functions,
* The quadratic polynomial and the parabola,
* Plane geometry and geometrical properties,
* Tangent to a curve and derivative of a function,
* Coordinate methods in geometry,
* Applications of geometrical properties,
* Geometrical applications of differentiation,
* Integration,
* Trigonometric functions,
* Logarithmic and exponential functions,
* Applications of calculus to the physical world,
* Probability,
* Series and series applications. 

Some of these topics will be treated as a pure prerequisite and will not be covered in the course. Others, such as calculus, will be an elementary part of EMET1001. Sections of the textbook that will be treated as assumed knowledge include chapters 1 and 2 as well as Appendix A. Many other topics will be developed from first principles. For example, in the study of financial mathematics, we begin with a brief refresher of sequences and series before we move on to more complicated formulas (such as the present value of an annuity).

=============
Tutorials
=============

In addition to lectures, you are expected to attend and actively participate in weekly tutorials (weeks 2 through 13). Tutes are an integral part of this course. During each tute, your tutor will develop and present solutions to selected exercises *in cooperation* with students. Solutions will not be made available in any other form.

Allocation to tutorial groups will be made via the ETA (Electronic Tutorial Administration) system which you can find following this `link <http://eta.fec.anu.edu.au/>`_. 


=============
Help Desk
=============

The EMET1001 helpdesk is by far the best and most flexible opportunity for students seeking answers to their EMET1001 questions. Tutors will be available to help you with any questions you might have regarding the course material. Each week (starting week 2) the help desk will be open for at least 4 hours. Exact days and times for each week will be posted here soon. 



=================================================
Lecture Attendance and Time Conflicts
=================================================

You are expected to attend all lectures and your weekly tutorial. You should not enrol in EMET1001 if you have persistent time conflicts with other lectures. Audio recordings may be made available.



******************************************
Course Requirement and Grade Composition
******************************************

Assessment in this course will consist of two *compulsory* examinations: a midterm exam and a final exam. 

============================================
Midterm Examination
============================================

The midterm examination is expected to be held during week 8 (23/09/2013 -- 27/09/2013) outside the usual lecture times (usually after 6pm). The exam covers material from weeks 1 through 6 of the lecture (and weeks 2 through 7 of the tutorials). Participation in the midterm exam is *compulsory*. The exam will be marked out of 100.

It is your responsibility to make yourselves available for the midterm examination during week 8. Details of the midterm exam will be announced as soon as the date is set and the venue is secured (the ANU examination office usually sets dates and times by the middle of August). As soon as I find out I will announce the exact date and time of the midterm exam in the lecture.

No make-up midterm examination will be offered. Should you miss the midterm exam for a valid reason (see Special Examinations below) then your grade will be based solely on your final exam.

============================================
Final Examination
============================================

Examinable material covers the whole semester, including material already covered in the midterm exam. Participation in the final exam is *compulsory* The exam will be marked out of 100.

The final exam will be held in the exam period at the end of the semester. Details will be posted on the ANU exam timetable site. 

============================================
Weighting Scheme
============================================

The highest final course mark (FCM) that you can achieve in EMET1001 is 100 which translates to a course grade of HD. You will obtain a FCM of 100 if you score maximal on both the midterm and the final exams. Between these two exams the following weighting scheme applies (midterm / final):

* scheme 1: 50\% / 50\%
* scheme 2: 25\% / 75\%

Whichever weighting scheme gives you a better FCM will be applied to you. Weighting scheme 2 makes the midterm exam partially redeemable (relative to scheme 1): 25 percentage points are shifted towards the final exam. 

====================
Scaling of Grades
====================

Final scores for the course will be determined by scaling the raw score totals to fit a sensible distribution of grades. Scaling can increase or decrease a mark but does not change the order of marks relative to the other students in the course. If it is decided that scaling is appropriate, then the final mark awarded in a course may differ from the aggregation of the raw marks of each assessment component.


*********************
Rules and Policies
*********************


========================
Special Examinations
========================

Both the midterm examination and the final examination are *compulsory* However, if you are unable to attend a scheduled examination due to *extraordinary circumstances* you may apply for a special examination. For details, check the ANU `Special Examinations Policy <http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/examinations-and-assessment/special-examinations/>`_

*Extraordinary circumstances* may include hospitalisation, inability to walk, or being so incapacitated that you cannot attend the examination room. For additional grounds for a special examination please read the `Special Examinations Protocol <http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/examinations-and-assessment/special-examinations/special-examination-protocol/>`_. The Special Examinations Protocol also lists in more detail circumstances that do NOT warrant special examination. 

When applying for a special examination you are required to provide appropriate evidence for non--attendance. In the case of illness or accident you must attend a doctor or medical clinic on the day of the examination, unless there are special and documented circumstances, and provide a medical certificate or police report where relevant. Please read the `Special Examinations Protocol <http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/examinations-and-assessment/special-examinations/special-examination-protocol/>`_ for more details regarding appropriate evidence and medical documentation.

If you have an ongoing medical condition you are advised to register with the Disability Services Centre. The Special Examinations policy is designed for short-term, unexpected illness. The Disability Services Centre is able to provide more practical solutions to long term medical conditions.

Requests for a Special Examination must be made on the standard University Application for `Special Examination Form <http://www.anu.edu.au/sas/forms/special_exam.pdf>`_. The completed Special Examination Form should be submitted to:

* Mid-Semester Examinations: Research School of Economics 
* Final Examinations: CBE Student Office

Applications lodged more than 3 working days after the date of the examination will not normally be accepted.

Do not assume that non-attendance at the examination and an application will lead to a special examination being given. The granting of a Special Examination is solely at the College's discretion and provision of a medical certification does not necessarily guarantee the granting of a special examination. The College will judge the severity based on the medical report and taking into account all relevant factors.


========================
Calculator Policy
========================

The only kind of calculator permissible in this course is a *non-programmable* calculator. All other types of calculators are not permitted. Examples of calculators that are not permitted include (but are not restricted to): programmable calculators, iPhones, Android phones, tablet computers.

========================
Communication Policies
========================

The official forum for announcements of any kind are the lectures. If necessary, I will contact students electronically using their official ANU student e-mail address. If you want to contact me send an e-mail to 

* juergen.meinecke\@anu.edu.au

E-mail addresses are only to be used when you need to contact staff about administrative or academic matters. They are NOT to be used for instructional purposes. 


========================
Workload
========================

University study requires at least as much time and effort as a full--time job. You are expected to attend all lectures and tutorials (4 hours per week). You should expect to put in at least 6 hours per week of your own study time for this course in addition to the 4 hours of lectures and tutorials. 

========================
Extra Examinations
========================

It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations and the policies and procedures that are relevant to your studies at the ANU. The following two links direct you to websites that contain information about proper academic conduct, academic honesty and plagiarism, discrimination, harassment and bullying, as well as examination policies (covering special considerations, supplementary examinations, and special examinations). You are expected to be aware of these policies: 

* `Policies and Procedures <http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/policies-and-procedures/>`_  
* `Examinations and Assessment <http://cbe.anu.edu.au/cbe/current-students/undergraduate-graduate-coursework/examinations-and-assessment/>`_

If you seek more information, please feel free to visit the College Office (room 2.01 CBE Building 26C) to talk to a student administrator.


===========================
Supplementary Examinations
===========================

Should you receive a mark of :math:`PX` you will be required to take a *written supplementary exam*. No other form of supplementary assessment will be offered (e.g., no oral examinations). None of you should ignore the possibility of having to take the supplementary exam. When you enroll in this course you implicitly agree to be able to take a supplementary exam, should it be required of you, at the *end of February 2014* (it will be your responsibility to contact the course administrator to inquire about the exact date). You are required to factor this into your planning for the coming summer. I do not accept requests for early supplementary exams.



========================
Misconduct
========================

In relation to an examination, misconduct on the part of a student includes:

* cheating;
* plagiarism (including the reproducing in, or submitting for assessment for, any examination, by way of copying, paraphrasing or summarizing, without acknowledgement and with the intention to deceive, any work of another person as the student's own work, with or without the knowledge or consent of that other person);
* submitting for an examination any work previously submitted for examination (except with the approval of the prescribed authority);
* failing to comply with the University's instructions to students at, or in relation to, an examination;
* acting, or assisting another person to act dishonestly, in or in connection with an examination;
* taking a prohibited document into an examination venue.

The administrative procedures regarding misconduct are incorporated in the ANU `Discipline Rules <http://about.anu.edu.au/__documents/rules/disciplinerules.pdf>`_.

========================
Academic Honesty
========================

The university has strict rules in relation to `Academic Honesty <http://academichonesty.anu.edu.au/>`_, visit the weblink to learn about the ANU's policies and advice on how you can avoid cheating and plagiarism!
